_This is adapted from a presentation I gave at Silicon Slopes Tech Summit in January of 2020. I have also added some commentary at the end to address some of the questions I recieved during the Q&A portion._

Starting off with a short history lesson. The image below is a picture of Milton Friedman, the world renound economist.

# Q&A

Starting with a history lesson, This is Milton Friedman. He published a paper in the New York Times in 1970 and proposed the idea that the “the sole purpose of a business is to generate profits for its shareholders.” This idea became pervasive through the late seventies and solidified even more during the 80’s
If anyone is old enough in here to have seen the movie Wall Street, Gordan Gekko’s “greed is good” speech is iconic from the era. Jack Welch, the CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001 and was by most measures, an incredible manager and CEO. He also popularized firing the bottom 10% performing managers every single year, despite actual performance. Like a curve grading for managers. Another funny thing, when I read his book “winning” the section on work life balance was pretty funny. You could sum it up with this description: “When I was CEO work life balance wasn’t a thing, but now I guess it is.” He also returned a 5000% stock value increase at GE against a stock market that only increased by 2500%. He further pushed this idea about solely benefiting shareholders, and in general, it is still pervasive today.
In August 2019, the Business Roundtable met, almost 50 years after Milton Friedman’s paper. The Business Roundtable has some of the best executives in the nation from Apple, Walmart, pepsi, etc. and they proposed this change to the purpose of business. They are proposing that ALL stakeholders deserve to get value out of a company. Shareholders yes, but not exclusively. Employees, customers, and the community around businesses all need to be accounted for.
I am extremely lucky, because Brandon Rodman, took a massive risk on bringing me on as a co-founder of Weave. One of the reasons why I think he took that risk is that we aligned on the things we thought were most important. Brandon and I both agree that Friedman’s idea was wrong, not just morally, but also when looking at the long term health of a company, and the nation as a whole.  Brandon espouses that People, Product, and Profits are the order we focus on things at Weave. And if we focus on the people, they will build a better product, and if we have a better product, we will have better profits. So now lets dig into some of the ways that we focus on the people at weave.
But before I get into some of these items, I want to just say that every company is unique, and in different places as far as size, and financially. These ideas are not cookie cutter solutions to make your company better, but they can inspire ideas for you to make it better.
Better Maternity/Paternity Policy
We give 12 weeks maternity and 6 weeks paternity
1 year of diapers
Every other week house cleaning for 12 weeks
Twice weekly meal delivery for 12 weeks
Not everyone reports on this but we have one of highest percentages of women working at weave and based on the data we have we one of the highest return rate of women coming back after maternity leave
Christmas party (bonus pool)
At the end of 2018 Brandon had an idea. We had doubled our annual recurring revenue that year and everyone at the company had pushed super hard to get there. Our board approved budget gave a certain percentage of payroll that could be allocated to bonuses. At typical companies the bulk of bonuses go to director level and above, and they trickle down to managers with a “Jam of the month club” subscription getting down to the individual contributor level. Brandon decided that everyone in the company was pushing so hard, they should all get an equal stake. He gave out 14 different items, including a Trager grill, apple air pods, and a cash bonus to EVERY employee. As he read off each item you could see everyones eyes get wider and wider, and cheering would get louder and louder, and when he announced the cash bonus you could even see some people crying. Brandon has said that it was one of the best days he has had at weave, and I would say it was definitely one of mine.
Coaching
Better Transparency (Income level discussion)
At weave we share our high level financial numbers with the whole company. Good and bad. 
Service Projects (Food drive)
Is this worth it? These are five examples among many we have tried to do at weave, and how do we know if it is worth it? I want to give you some data to show it absolutely is. Working backwards this time, from profit to product to people.
We doubled, we double, we are awesome
We have super low churn and high usage
eNPS score > 80. For those that aren’t familiar with Net Promoter Score, it is a one question survey that asks how likely are you to refer a friend to work at weave. NPS scores range from -100 to 100 and I can tell you, 80 is outstanding. Our investors have never heard of a score that high. So our employees by and large are extremely happy at weave, enough that they would recommend us to others.
Here is another metric. The one I am most proud of. 2. We now have over 100 people in product and engineering at Weave and this number, 2, is the number of engineers that have left weave to go work at other companies, over the last 3 years. 3 years. Imagine the cost savings. The knowledge. The ability to not have to focus so much on ramping up new employees, the general cohesiveness of working together. I can tell you, we couldn’t have done what we did at weave with high or even average engineering turnover.
