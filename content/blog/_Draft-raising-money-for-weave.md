A Unique Opportunity
- A cool product, and cool opportunity, not very much equity

Almost Dead #1
- Running out of money... time to beg
- Raised money from rich uncle
- No henry schein deal and fallout. "You're a liar!" "Our pockets are deeper than yours..."
- Meeting individually to make sure people were on his side

Almost Dead #2
- Hiring an investor is the worst
- Hiring his accountant friend out of college is the next worst
- Whoops, forgot an expense... layoffs
- Salvation of YC
- New Equity Split and Brandon's regrets

YC and Raising Series A
- Benefits and pitfalls of YC for a company further along
- How sales grew (and didn't really grow)
- Playing the game to raise a series A... one term sheet is enough...

Almost Dead #3
- How we spent 5 million and took 2 million in debt in 9 months
- Opportunistic fund-raising in November
- Focussed fund-raising in May
- Excuses VCs used to turn us down: In Utah, first time founders (weren't impressed with us), market size isn't big enough
- Playing the VC game... One term sheet is enough
- Churn? I don't even want May's numbers so please don't tell them to me...

Time To Grow
- How to make the tech stack keep up
- Integrations in legacy world
