### A Brief Timeline of my Early Technical History

**1988** &#8211; I am 6 years old and my mother gets a home computer from her employer (JCPenney). I am hooked. I play Pitfall and mess around with DOS.

**1992** &#8211; My family gets a new Compaq 386 computer with Windows 3.0. I am blown away. I am introduced to QBasic by a neighbor and start programming for the first time. I am shocked I can make this awesome machine do things by simply giving it commands.

**1995** &#8211; My family gets another computer upgrade, a Packard Bell bundled Windows 95. We get access to the internet via modem. Webcrawler is my search engine of choice.

**1996** &#8211; I create my first GeoCities account and start learning HTML. I am enthralled with the Internet.

**1998** &#8211; In 9th grade a friend and I post a website for our school where students can print hall passes and view curriculums from classes. Teachers are upset, but no disciplinary action taken.

**2000** &#8211; Two friends and I enter an educational website competition and we each win $100. We build the site with PHP. I still haven&#8217;t grasped that web development will be my future career. I spend hours trying to do my first Red Hat linux installation.

**2001** &#8211; A friend and I break into the school network. We don&#8217;t change any grades, but we do have a little fun (transferring students we didn&#8217;t like to ridiculous classes). We get busted and suspended for 5 days.

**2004** &#8211; I start college at Utah Valley University and play on the lacrosse team. I have a job at Kinkos and I take my first class on linux and start c++ classes.

**2005** &#8211; I quit Kinkos and start work for Avinti building a web-based dashboard for viewing email anti-virus data (PHP). It is my first time getting paid for programming and I love it!

**2006** &#8211; I land my first independent software contract for a web-based sales tracking software. The company uses it for 3 years and I sell all the rights to the software. I realize that my passion lies in web-based software, especially software-as-a-service.
