I am a full-stack web developer and wannabe entrepreneur. I am passionate about start-up companies and want to build my own successful business.

Some of the things I love (in no particular order, except the first):

I love my wife
  
I love wakeboarding
  
I love snow skiing
  
I love reading
  
I love ping-pong (if I don&#8217;t call it table tennis it doesn&#8217;t mean I suck)
  
I love start-up companies
  
I love e-commerce
