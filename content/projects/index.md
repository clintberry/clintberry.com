All projects that I release to the public are hosted at [my GitHub account][1].

## ZFcodo

Code Generator for Zend Framework based on Qcodo/Qcubed code generation. Read more at [this post][2].

The project is hosted at the [zf-codo github][3].

## StickerMeMine

I am the founder of this soon-to-launch company. I am currently building a web-based sticker creator using Javascript, SVG, and @font-face technology. This project is heavily based on the amazing [svg-edit project][4].
