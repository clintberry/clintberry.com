I want to go more in-depth into what brackets is and why we chose it as our solution. This will be the first of a series of posts dedicated to brackets-shell and customizing it for your native HTML desktop applications.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I Posted part 2 of the series: <a href=http://clintberry.com/2013/native-desktop-javascript/ title="JavaScript and the Brackets Shell Environment">JavaScript and the Brackets Shell Environment</a></p><h4 id=what-is-brackets>What is Brackets?</h4><p><a href=http://brackets.io/ title=Brackets target=_blank>Brackets</a> is an open-source code editor created by Adobe. What makes brackets so cool, though, is that the entire editor is written in HTML and JavaScript. This puts Brackets in a unique opportunity that allows pretty much any developer that would use the editor (HTML and JavaScript guys) to add to and improve the editor with the very languages they use on a regular basis. And while I don’t use brackets myself just yet (hard to leave Sublime Text) it is definitely on my radar and I may make that switch soon.</p><h4 id=what-is-brackets-shell>What is Brackets Shell?</h4><p>Brackets Shell is what allows Brackets to be run as a desktop application. It takes <a href=https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/ title="Chromium Embedded Framework" target=_blank>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</a> and adds some extras along with an excellent build tool. The brackets-shell app is so well done, it made it easy for a web-developer like me to get my first ever <a href=https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/commit/5e52d8647444d20838a2b01bfff92f463109f014 title="My first c++ pull request" target=_blank>C++ pull request accepted</a> (I took credit for that whole pull request, but the windows portion was done by my good friend, <a href=http://bigdevblog.com title="Jordan C's Blog" target=_blank>Jordan</a>).</p><h4 id=why-use-brackets-shell-instead-of-other-solutions>Why Use Brackets Shell Instead of Other Solutions?</h4><p>I’m glad you asked:</p><ul><li><strong>Very active development</strong> – Of all the HTML shells for the desktop, this one was the most active in terms of code being committed.</li><li><strong>Backed by Adobe</strong> – A corporate sponsor doesn’t guarantee that the project will be around forever, but it is more promising than not having one</li><li><strong>NodeJS Integration</strong> – The brackets team recently integrated NodeJS into the brackets shell which allows for some really awesome plugin capabilities without learning C++</li><li><strong>The Build Process</strong> – Building cross platform desktop applications can be a pain. Unless someone went through all the pain for you and automated the whole thing, including the creation of the installer. And on top of that, did it in Grunt, which most JavaScript developers are already familiar with. But who would do that for you? The Brackets team did. Amazing.</li></ul><p>Now on to the good stuff.</p><h4 id=test-your-application-in-brackets-shell>Test Your Application in Brackets Shell</h4><p>The first thing you will want to do is test the shell to see if your HTML application runs in it. The quickest route to doing this is to <a href=http://download.brackets.io/ title="Download Brackets" target=_blank>download the latest Brackets editor</a> and install it. The installer installs the brackets-shell along with the brackets HTML application. If you remove the HTML app then the when you run the brackets shell it will ask you for the location of your index.html file. If you choose your own index.html file from your own application, brackets shell will open that.</p><p>To remove the brackets HTML app on Windows, browse to the Brackets folder in your Program Files directory. Inside the Brackets folder there is a folder named ‘www’. Rename or delete that folder, then run Brackets. The file dialog will open prompting you to select your own index.html file.</p><p>On OSX, open the terminal and browse to your application directory. Applications in OSX are actually folders, and in terminal you can view their content. CD into the Brackets Sprint [sprint number].app folder and continue to the Contents directory. Inside there you will see the www folder. Delete or rename it and then run brackets. You will see the file dialog prompting you to select your own index.html file.</p><h4 id=building-brackets-shell>Building Brackets Shell</h4><p>If your app runs well in brackets-shell your next step is to setup your computer to build brackets-shell. This is where the shell really shines. They have an amazing Grunt setup that allows you to run the build in one command. Brackets provides some great instructions on <a href=https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/wiki/Building-brackets-shell title="Brackets shell build instructions" target=_blank>setting up your box here</a>. Once you are setup, run `grunt build` from the command line and it should create a full build of brackets shell for you. So awesome.</p><h4 id=setup-for-your-app>Setup for Your App</h4><p>This is where things get fun. Let’s make the shell be a full-on desktop app for our own software. Make sure you have followed the instructions for getting setup to build brackets-shell and then take these next steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fork the Repo</strong> – I recommend you fork the bracket-shell repo on github so you have a place to persist your own changes. Once you do that, then check out your forked repo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make your app folder a sibling of the shell folder</strong> – The build scripts from brackets are setup to expect your HTML app source code to be in a sibling folder to the brackets-shell folder</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Git for your HTML app</strong> – To use the build scripts provided by brackets, you need to be using Git with your source code. If you aren’t using git for your project, cd into your project folder and type `git init` and commit your project to the repo by doing `git add .` and then `git commit -m “Initial commit”`</p></li><li><p><strong>Update grunt file</strong> – If your html application folder is called my-app, then you need to tell Grunt where it is. Edit Gruntfile.js in the root of the brackets-shell folder and change the config section git->www->repo from “../brackets” to “../my-app”, and also change www->files->cwd value by removing ‘src’ from the end of the file (assuming your index.html file is in the root of your project) then save the file.</p><p><img src=http://clintberry.com/images/Screen-Shot-2013-06-21-at-4.59.21-PM.png alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-21 at 4.59.21 PM" width=739 height=286 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-967"></p></li></ul><p><img src=http://clintberry.com/images/Screen-Shot-2013-06-21-at-6.08.39-PM.png alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-21 at 6.08.39 PM" width=620 height=194 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-980"></p><p>Now you are all setup.

</pre><p>Look at all that goodness! So many Grunt commands at your disposal all ready to go.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is run the cef command, which will download Chromium Embedded Framework and prep it for your build. Type `grunt cef` in your terminal and you should see something like this:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">$ grunt cef
Running "cef" task

Running "cef-download" task
Downloading http://dev.brackets.io/cef/cef_binary_3.1453.1255_macosx.zip. This may take a while...

Running "curl-dir:cef-mac" (curl-dir) task
Files "downloads/cef_binary_3.1453.1255_macosx.zip" created.

Running "cef-clean" task

Running "cef-extract" task

Running "cef-symlinks" task

Done, without errors.

</pre><p>Now do the same thing for node.js by typeing `grunt node` in the terminal:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">$ grunt node
Running "node" task
Downloading node-v0.8.20-darwin-x86.tar.gz. This may take a while...

Running "curl-dir:node-mac" (curl-dir) task
Files "downloads/node-v0.8.20-darwin-x86.tar.gz" created.

Running "node-clean" task

Running "node-mac" task

Done, without errors.
</pre><p>Now you are ready to do a full-build. To do that (yup, you guessed it) type `grunt full-build`. It will take a bit of time, and will end with a warning:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">Warning: Unable to read "installer/mac/staging/Brackets.app/Contents/www/config.json" file (Error code: ENOENT). Use --force to continue.
</pre><p>Don’t worry about the warning, if you made it that far you made a full build! You can check out your newly-built app in the brackets-shell/installer/(mac or win, depending on your OS)/staging folder. Run it and make sure it loads your index.html file by default now. (it shouldn’t prompt you to locate an index.html file, it should just open and run the one from your html application)</p><h4 id=let8217s-customize>Let’s customize!</h4><p>You probably noticed your new application’s name was “brackets” and that your icon for the app was the brackets logo. You don’t want that, so let’s change the name of your app to “Awesome”.</p><p>There are a couple of places you will need to change to get your app name changed:</p><ol><li>Gruntfile.js – change the build name</li></ol><p><img src=http://clintberry.com/images/Screen-Shot-2013-06-24-at-3.07.07-PM.png alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-24 at 3.07.07 PM" width=452 height=100 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996"></p><ol start=2><li>appshell/config.h – Change the app-name for windows and osx</li></ol><p><img src=http://clintberry.com/images/Screen-Shot-2013-06-24-at-3.06.13-PM.png alt="Screen Shot 2013-06-24 at 3.06.13 PM" width=486 height=324 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-995"></p><ol start=3><li>appshell_config.gypi – Change the app-name as well</li></ol><p><img src=http://clintberry.com/images/Screen-Shot-2013-08-01-at-12.46.32-PM.png alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-01 at 12.46.32 PM" width=354 height=107 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1076"></p><p>Now just type `grunt full-build` at the terminal and it will create a build with your app and name the app “awesome”</p><h4 id=what8217s-next>What’s Next?</h4><p>For basic HTML apps that you just need a shell for, this might be all you need. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with brackets-shell. Over the next few weeks I will be posting new tutorials showing how you can:</p><ul><li>Use built-in JavaScript functions that map to window functions (Drag, Quit, Create popups)</li><li>Map custom JavaScript functions to C++ functions that alter the window in other ways</li><li>Add features like Tray icons in windows, and stay on top of all other windows all the time</li><li>Use node for advanced tasks and call those tasks from JavaScript in the browser window</li></ul><p>As always, let me know if you have any comments or questions!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2010 - 2020
