&lt;p>At my current job all the database systems are managed by DB admins and the developers have to connect to the database via web services. We do not connect to the databases directly. This allows for better &lt;a title="Separation of Concerns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">separation of concerns&lt;/a> and allows experts to focus on their respective specialties. But if you are programming a Symfony2 app, that means you don’t get to use Doctrine or any other ORM, which in turn means you create your own models/entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you want to develop the authentication parts of your new app you will quickly find that there is plenty of documentation for Doctrine/ORM based apps, but if you are using your own custom models then you run into pages &lt;del datetime="2012-01-20T21:30:13+00:00">&lt;a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/custom_provider.html" target="_blank">like this one&lt;/a>&lt;/del>.  &lt;del datetime="2012-01-20T21:30:13+00:00">(when I finish this post I will submit an article to the docs and see if they approve it)&lt;/del> &lt;strong>UPDATE: Someone beat me to it, there is now a good tutorial in the Symfony docs for custom user providers.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Switched to Symfony 2 Framework</title><link>https://clintberry.com/2011/switched-symfony-2-framework/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clintberry.com/2011/switched-symfony-2-framework/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been working with the Zend Framework for the last 3 years. I like it. It is flexible, heavily object oriented, and organized. However, one thing that has always bothered me is that modules in ZF have been &lt;a title="Zend Framework Modules" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/234-Module-Bootstraps-in-Zend-Framework-Dos-and-Donts.html" target="_blank">second-class citizens&lt;/a>. Granted, in Zend Framework 2 this is not the case, but I needed to start a project right away, and since ZF2 is still in beta, I decided to go checkout some other frameworks again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
