This allows you to map folders in your web root to sub-domains on your local box. Why would you want to do this? It is nice to be able to type use &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://myproject.clint.dev">http://myproject.clint.dev&lt;/a>&lt;/em> for the URL and have it map to the ‘myproject’ folder on your local box. No need to add a line to the etc/hosts file, and no need to add a virtual host in apache for each sub-domain. The method I will be outlining here will allow you to map x.yourdevdomain.dev to any folder ‘x’ using Bind and a wildcard virtual host in apache. This tutorial assumes you already have Apache setup on your local box.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
