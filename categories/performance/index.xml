It is a great tool and I suggest you read more about it &lt;a href="http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago, I needed to test a part of my application that was behind a login. I hit up UPHPU user group on IRC, and &lt;a href="http://www.justincarmony.com/" target="_blank">Carmony&lt;/a> (a master website optimizer) suggested logging in on my browser and then hijacking the session in siege by setting header values. That is a great idea, but seems overly difficult. I doubted that I was the only one that ever wanted to do this. Isnâ€™t there an easier way?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
