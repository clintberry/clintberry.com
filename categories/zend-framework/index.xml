Extremely fast inserts, map-reduce for complex queries, and most importantly, scaling is a breeze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I am a Zend Framework guy I created a simple base model class for MongoDB. It is a very simple wrapper, but is effective for what I need. I usually create model classes for each “Collection” just like I would create models for each table in MySQL. Each model class extends from the new MongoDB base class and allows a low level “active directory” type access to MongoDB documents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zend Framework Code Generator With Scaffolding &amp;#8211; ZFcodo</title><link>https://clintberry.com/2010/zend-framework-code-generator-with-scaffolding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clintberry.com/2010/zend-framework-code-generator-with-scaffolding/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> This project is now hosted at my &lt;a href="https://github.com/clintberry/zf-codo">GitHub account&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I am a huge fan of Zend Framework, I miss having the code generation that is bundled with other frameworks I use. Since my favorite codegen/ORM is from the Qcubed project, I decided to take the Qcubed code generator and customize it for Zend Framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Custom Error Messages on Zend Form Validators</title><link>https://clintberry.com/2010/zend-form-email-validator-customizing-error-messages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clintberry.com/2010/zend-form-email-validator-customizing-error-messages/</guid><description>&lt;p>Zend Form is extremely powerful, and I love most of the built in validators. But some of the validators are overkill for many projects. Take the EmailAddress validator for instance. I have never worked on a web-form where I wanted 3 error messages to appear if the Email address entered was invalid. (To see what I mean, just type in “a@a” for your email address and see what Zend_Validate_EmailAddress displays). I have seen several questions and complaints about this problem (&lt;a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2224">Example 1&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://www.zfforums.com/zend-framework-general-discussions-1/general-q-zend-framework-2/how-can-i-get-just-1-error-message-emailaddress-validator-instead-multiple-2582.html">Example 2&lt;/a>) and thought I would offer up my fix.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
