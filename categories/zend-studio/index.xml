Zend Studio Eclipse plays very nicely with SVN out of the box, but lately it seems Git has gained a lot of momentum so I thought I would look into it. It turns out Git is awesome and is much better suited for many of the things I do. (See: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/871/why-is-git-better-than-subversion">Why Git?&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But will Git play nicely with Zend Studio 8?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to eclipse plugins, you bet it will!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
