As we have grown (now to over 60 engineers) it gets harder and harder to manage the communication and operational culture of the department. In some ways, things have to change (you just can&amp;rsquo;t operate the same way as you did with 10 engineers) but there are other cultural values that you do not want to change&amp;hellip; ever.</description></item><item><title>Measuring your Engineering Culture</title><link>https://clintberry.com/measuring-your-engineering-culture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clintberry.com/measuring-your-engineering-culture/</guid><description>Creating the right operational culture for your engineering team is critical to having a high performing team.

So I have spent some time researching the role, and interviewing several CTOs to get an idea of their responsibilities and day-to-day workflow.
