On the #plivo IRC channel, I see new people, usually web developers like me, getting stuck at this spot all the time.</p><h6 id=dialplan-basics>Dialplan Basics</h6><p>The dialplan in freeswitch essentially tells freeswitch how to route calls when they come in. An out-of-the box freeswitch setup installs 20 extensions (just like an office phone system) with passwords to login. The extensions are 1000-1020 and all have the same password – 1234. With the Plivo FreeSWITCH installer, the default dialplan is overwritten to intercept all calls and those extensions don’t work very well anymore. If you are just getting started with the whole freeswitch thing, I have provided an alternate version of the dialplan file to allow you to do testing of your freeswitch install as well as develop Plivo apps.</p><p><a href=http://clintberry.com/download/default.xml>Download Dialplan Here – default.xml</a></p><p>Copy that dialplan into the freeswitch/conf/dialplan directory. This dialplan is the same as the out of the box FreeSWITCH dialplan, except I added the plivo config and restricted it to extension 1005. This means the rest of your extensions will work like normal so you can see how awesome freeswitch is. Restart freeswitch by typing ‘shutdown’ in the freeswitch terminal.</p><h4 id=step-5-8211-get-a-free-softphone-for-testing>Step 5 – Get a Free SoftPhone For Testing</h4><p>Now things start to get fun. Get a free soft phone. For osx I got <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blink-lite/id431473881?mt=12">Blink Lite</a>. Once you get a free soft phone you can login to your FreeSWITCH install by extension and IP address. If you installed freeswitch on 192.168.1.5 then for your credentials on your softphone you would use <a href=mailto:1000@192.168.1.5>1000@192.168.1.5</a> as the user, and 1234 as the password. You should get logged right in and now you can call any other extension. Try dialing 1001 and you should get taken to voicemail. Pretty sweet right? Try dialing 1005 and right now you should get nothing but a disconnected call, since 1005 is now connected to plivo.</p><h4 id=step-6-8211-configure-plivo>Step 6 – Configure Plivo</h4><p>The last step before you take over the world with your new telephony app is configuring plivo. This is extremely easy. Go to your plivo install directory (typically /usr/local/plivo) and go to the etc/plivo directory. Open the default.conf file and look for these directives:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">DEFAULT_ANSWER_URL = http://127.0.0.1:3000/answer/
DEFAULT_HANGUP_URL = http://127.0.0.1:3000/hangup/</pre><p>Typically your web server won’t be tied to port 3000. You need to change these values to point to your web server IP address and port (typically 80). Also, change the URL to point wherever your app will be. I will leave mine pointing to /answer. Then make sure FreeSWITCH is started and go ahead and start plivo:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">/usr/local/plivo/bin/plivo start</pre><h4 id=step-7-8211-hello-world>Step 7 – Hello World</h4><p>FINALLY, TIME FOR AN AWESOME PHONE APP! Your system is all setup, and plivo will be answering all calls on extension 1005. Let’s write our first app. I will make this first app in PHP, but I won’t be doing anything special, it will work on any web language that can serve an xml file. Since plivo is pointing to answer/ I will create answer/index.php and inside that file I will put plivo response xml code:</p><pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Response&gt;
     &lt;Speak&gt;Hello World&lt;/Speak&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;</pre><p>Now open your soft phone and dial 1005. You should hear a pleasant voice, saying “hello world”. It should be an exciting moment for you.</p><p>Now your limits are endless. Write some amazing telephony apps in a web language and let me know some of the cool projects you are building. I’ve got several more posts planned about building plivo apps coming in the next few weeks, so be ready for some exciting developments.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2010 - 2020
